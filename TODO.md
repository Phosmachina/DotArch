## TODO

### Feature

- Take into account double configuration for polybar.
- Add a way to encrypt file with ansible.
- Clean pacman.conf
- In place of history, make function, scripts and a cheatsheet: history should not be
  stored.
- TODO Maybe move `onedark.rasi` in rofi config folder.
- Review script files and upgrade it. e.g.:
    - pandoc helper: Is there already a better tool for this?
    - a-yt-dl can purpose a streaming mode.
    - many scripts miss dependency check and don't have usage/help.
